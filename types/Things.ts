 * @property {Text | URL} An [EIDR](https://eidr.org/) (Entertainment Identifier Registry) [[identifier]] representing at the most general/abstract level, a work of film or television.  For example, the motion picture known as "Ghostbusters" has a titleEIDR of  "10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J". This title (or work) may have several variants, which EIDR calls "edits". See [[editEIDR]].  Since schema.org types like [[Movie]], [[TVEpisode]], [[TVSeason]], and [[TVSeries]] can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use [[titleEIDR]] alone (for a general description), or alongside [[editEIDR]] for a more edit-specific description.

/**
 * Any offered product or service. For example: a pair of shoes; a concert ticket; the rental of a car; a haircut; or an episode of a TV show streamed online.
 * @property {Organization} The manufacturer of the product.
 * @property {Text} The GTIN-12 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. The GTIN-12 is the 12-digit GS1 Identification Key composed of a U.P.C. Company Prefix, Item Reference, and Check Digit used to identify trade items. See [GS1 GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) for more details.
 * @property {Date} The release date of a product or product model. This can be used to distinguish the exact variant of a product.
 * @property {Text | DefinedTerm} A pattern that something has, for example 'polka dot', 'striped', 'Canadian flag'. Values are typically expressed as text, although links to controlled value schemes are also supported.
 * @property {Text} The [[mobileUrl]] property is provided for specific situations in which data consumers need to determine whether one of several provided URLs is a dedicated 'mobile site'.  To discourage over-use, and reflecting intial usecases, the property is expected only on [[Product]] and [[Offer]], rather than [[Thing]]. The general trend in web technology is towards [responsive design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) in which content can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of browsing environments. Pages and sites referenced with the long-established [[url]] property should ideally also be usable on a wide variety of devices, including mobile phones. In most cases, it would be pointless and counter productive to attempt to update all [[url]] markup to use [[mobileUrl]] for more mobile-oriented pages. The property is intended for the case when items (primarily [[Product]] and [[Offer]]) have extra URLs hosted on an additional "mobile site" alongside the main one. It should not be taken as an endorsement of this publication style.     
 * @property {Grant} A [[Grant]] that directly or indirectly provide funding or sponsorship for this item. See also [[ownershipFundingInfo]].
 * @property {Review} Review of the item.
 * @property {QuantitativeValue | Text | DefinedTerm | SizeSpecification} A standardized size of a product or creative work, specified either through a simple textual string (for example 'XL', '32Wx34L'), a  QuantitativeValue with a unitCode, or a comprehensive and structured [[SizeSpecification]]; in other cases, the [[width]], [[height]], [[depth]] and [[weight]] properties may be more applicable. 
 * @property {Text} The place where the product was assembled.
 * @property {Text} The product identifier, such as ISBN. For example: ``` meta itemprop="productID" content="isbn:123-456-789" ```.
 * @property {QuantitativeValue | Distance} The height of the item.
 * @property {MerchantReturnPolicy} Specifies a MerchantReturnPolicy that may be applicable.
 * @property {Text | PhysicalActivityCategory | URL | CategoryCode | Thing} A category for the item. Greater signs or slashes can be used to informally indicate a category hierarchy.
 * @property {Text} The Manufacturer Part Number (MPN) of the product, or the product to which the offer refers.
 * @property {Demand | Offer} An offer to provide this item&#x2014;for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use [[businessFunction]] to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a [[Demand]]. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer.       
 * @property {Country} The country of origin of something, including products as well as creative  works such as movie and TV content.  In the case of TV and movie, this would be the country of the principle offices of the production company or individual responsible for the movie. For other kinds of [[CreativeWork]] it is difficult to provide fully general guidance, and properties such as [[contentLocation]] and [[locationCreated]] may be more applicable.  In the case of products, the country of origin of the product. The exact interpretation of this may vary by context and product type, and cannot be fully enumerated here.
 * @property {Product} A pointer to another product (or multiple products) for which this product is an accessory or spare part.
 * @property {Audience} An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was created.
 * @property {Boolean} Indicates whether this content is family friendly.
 * @property {Text} The Stock Keeping Unit (SKU), i.e. a merchant-specific identifier for a product or service, or the product to which the offer refers.
 * @property {QuantitativeValue} The weight of the product or person.
 * @property {Distance | QuantitativeValue} The width of the item.
 * @property {Text} The GTIN-14 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. See [GS1 GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) for more details.
 * @property {WebContent | ItemList | Text | ListItem} Provides positive considerations regarding something, for example product highlights or (alongside [[negativeNotes]]) pro/con lists for reviews.  In the case of a [[Review]], the property describes the [[itemReviewed]] from the perspective of the review; in the case of a [[Product]], the product itself is being described.  The property values can be expressed either as unstructured text (repeated as necessary), or if ordered, as a list (in which case the most positive is at the beginning of the list).
 * @property {Brand | Organization} The brand(s) associated with a product or service, or the brand(s) maintained by an organization or business person.
 * @property {Product | Service} A pointer to another, somehow related product (or multiple products).
 * @property {AggregateRating} The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item.
 * @property {Text} Indicates the [[productGroupID]] for a [[ProductGroup]] that this product [[isVariantOf]]. 
 * @property {Text} Awards won by or for this item.
 * @property {ProductModel | ProductGroup} Indicates the kind of product that this is a variant of. In the case of [[ProductModel]], this is a pointer (from a ProductModel) to a base product from which this product is a variant. It is safe to infer that the variant inherits all product features from the base model, unless defined locally. This is not transitive. In the case of a [[ProductGroup]], the group description also serves as a template, representing a set of Products that vary on explicitly defined, specific dimensions only (so it defines both a set of variants, as well as which values distinguish amongst those variants). When used with [[ProductGroup]], this property can apply to any [[Product]] included in the group.
 * @property {ProductModel | Text} The model of the product. Use with the URL of a ProductModel or a textual representation of the model identifier. The URL of the ProductModel can be from an external source. It is recommended to additionally provide strong product identifiers via the gtin8/gtin13/gtin14 and mpn properties.
 * @property {PropertyValue} A property-value pair representing an additional characteristic of the entity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there is no matching property in schema.org.\n\nNote: Publishers should be aware that applications designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. https://schema.org/width, https://schema.org/color, https://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic property/value mechanism. 
 * @property {EnergyConsumptionDetails} Defines the energy efficiency Category (also known as "class" or "rating") for a product according to an international energy efficiency standard.
 * @property {OfferItemCondition} A predefined value from OfferItemCondition specifying the condition of the product or service, or the products or services included in the offer. Also used for product return policies to specify the condition of products accepted for returns.
 * @property {Text} The color of the product.
 * @property {URL | Text | DefinedTerm} Keywords or tags used to describe some item. Multiple textual entries in a keywords list are typically delimited by commas, or by repeating the property.
 * @property {Text} The GTIN-8 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. This code is also known as EAN/UCC-8 or 8-digit EAN. See [GS1 GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) for more details.
 * @property {Text} Indicates the [NATO stock number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_Stock_Number) (nsn) of a [[Product]]. 
 * @property {URL | Product | Text} A material that something is made from, e.g. leather, wool, cotton, paper.
 * @property {Review} A review of the item.
 * @property {Date} The date the item, e.g. vehicle, was purchased by the current owner.
 * @property {QuantitativeValue} A product measurement, for example the inseam of pants, the wheel size of a bicycle, or the gauge of a screw. Usually an exact measurement, but can also be a range of measurements for adjustable products, for example belts and ski bindings.
 * @property {Text | ListItem | WebContent | ItemList} Provides negative considerations regarding something, most typically in pro/con lists for reviews (alongside [[positiveNotes]]). For symmetry   In the case of a [[Review]], the property describes the [[itemReviewed]] from the perspective of the review; in the case of a [[Product]], the product itself is being described. Since product descriptions  tend to emphasise positive claims, it may be relatively unusual to find [[negativeNotes]] used in this way. Nevertheless for the sake of symmetry, [[negativeNotes]] can be used on [[Product]].  The property values can be expressed either as unstructured text (repeated as necessary), or if ordered, as a list (in which case the most negative is at the beginning of the list).
 * @property {Text | URL} A Global Trade Item Number ([GTIN](https://www.gs1.org/standards/id-keys/gtin)). GTINs identify trade items, including products and services, using numeric identification codes.  The GS1 [digital link specifications](https://www.gs1.org/standards/Digital-Link/) express GTINs as URLs (URIs, IRIs, etc.). Details including regular expression examples can be found in, Section 6 of the GS1 URI Syntax specification; see also [schema.org tracking issue](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/3156#issuecomment-1209522809) for schema.org-specific discussion. A correct [[gtin]] value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a "GS1 Digital Link" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a [valid GS1 check digit](https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator) and meet the other rules for valid GTINs. See also [GS1's GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Trade_Item_Number) for more details. Left-padding of the gtin values is not required or encouraged. The [[gtin]] property generalizes the earlier [[gtin8]], [[gtin12]], [[gtin13]], and [[gtin14]] properties.  Note also that this is a definition for how to include GTINs in Schema.org data, and not a definition of GTINs in general - see the GS1 documentation for authoritative details.
 * @property {Product} A pointer to another product (or multiple products) for which this product is a consumable.
 * @property {QuantitativeValue | Distance} The depth of the item.
 * @property {Text} The GTIN-13 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. This is equivalent to 13-digit ISBN codes and EAN UCC-13. Former 12-digit UPC codes can be converted into a GTIN-13 code by simply adding a preceding zero. See [GS1 GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) for more details.
 * @property {Date} The date of production of the item, e.g. vehicle.
 * @property {Text} An award won by or for this item.
 * @property {Text} The place where the item (typically [[Product]]) was last processed and tested before importation.
 * @property {AdultOrientedEnumeration} Used to tag an item to be intended or suitable for consumption or use by adults only.
 * @property {URL | Text} An Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN) is a 10-character alphanumeric unique identifier assigned by Amazon.com and its partners for product identification within the Amazon organization (summary from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Standard_Identification_Number)'s article).  Note also that this is a definition for how to include ASINs in Schema.org data, and not a definition of ASINs in general - see documentation from Amazon for authoritative details. ASINs are most commonly encoded as text strings, but the [asin] property supports URL/URI as potential values too.
 * @property {Text} A slogan or motto associated with the item.
 * @property {ImageObject | URL} An associated logo.
 * @property {Service | Product} A pointer to another, functionally similar product (or multiple products).

/**
 * A schedule defines a repeating time period used to describe a regularly occurring [[Event]]. At a minimum a schedule will specify [[repeatFrequency]] which describes the interval between occurrences of the event. Additional information can be provided to specify the schedule more precisely.       This includes identifying the day(s) of the week or month when the recurring event will take place, in addition to its start and end time. Schedules may also       have start and end dates to indicate when they are active, e.g. to define a limited calendar of events.
 * @property {Integer} Defines the day(s) of the month on which a recurring [[Event]] takes place. Specified as an [[Integer]] between 1-31.
 * @property {Text | Duration} Defines the frequency at which [[Event]]s will occur according to a schedule [[Schedule]]. The intervals between       events should be defined as a [[Duration]] of time.
 * @property {DateTime | Date} Defines a [[Date]] or [[DateTime]] during which a scheduled [[Event]] will not take place. The property allows exceptions to       a [[Schedule]] to be specified. If an exception is specified as a [[DateTime]] then only the event that would have started at that specific date and time       should be excluded from the schedule. If an exception is specified as a [[Date]] then any event that is scheduled for that 24 hour period should be       excluded from the schedule. This allows a whole day to be excluded from the schedule without having to itemise every scheduled event.
 * @property {Text | DayOfWeek} Defines the day(s) of the week on which a recurring [[Event]] takes place. May be specified using either [[DayOfWeek]], or alternatively [[Text]] conforming to iCal's syntax for byDay recurrence rules.
 * @property {Integer} Defines the week(s) of the month on which a recurring Event takes place. Specified as an Integer between 1-5. For clarity, byMonthWeek is best used in conjunction with byDay to indicate concepts like the first and third Mondays of a month.
 * @property {Time | DateTime} The startTime of something. For a reserved event or service (e.g. FoodEstablishmentReservation), the time that it is expected to start. For actions that span a period of time, when the action was performed. E.g. John wrote a book from *January* to December. For media, including audio and video, it's the time offset of the start of a clip within a larger file.\n\nNote that Event uses startDate/endDate instead of startTime/endTime, even when describing dates with times. This situation may be clarified in future revisions.
 * @property {Duration} The duration of the item (movie, audio recording, event, etc.) in [ISO 8601 date format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).
 * @property {Date | DateTime} The start date and time of the item (in [ISO 8601 date format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)).
 * @property {Integer} Defines the number of times a recurring [[Event]] will take place.
 * @property {Text} Indicates the timezone for which the time(s) indicated in the [[Schedule]] are given. The value provided should be among those listed in the IANA Time Zone Database.
 * @property {DateTime | Date} The end date and time of the item (in [ISO 8601 date format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)).
 * @property {Time | DateTime} The endTime of something. For a reserved event or service (e.g. FoodEstablishmentReservation), the time that it is expected to end. For actions that span a period of time, when the action was performed. E.g. John wrote a book from January to *December*. For media, including audio and video, it's the time offset of the end of a clip within a larger file.\n\nNote that Event uses startDate/endDate instead of startTime/endTime, even when describing dates with times. This situation may be clarified in future revisions.
 * @property {Integer} Defines the month(s) of the year on which a recurring [[Event]] takes place. Specified as an [[Integer]] between 1-12. January is 1.

/**
 * Instances of the class [[Observation]] are used to specify observations about an entity at a particular time. The principal properties of an [[Observation]] are [[observationAbout]], [[measuredProperty]], [[statType]], [[value] and [[observationDate]]  and [[measuredProperty]]. Some but not all Observations represent a [[QuantitativeValue]]. Quantitative observations can be about a [[StatisticalVariable]], which is an abstract specification about which we can make observations that are grounded at a particular location and time.       Observations can also encode a subset of simple RDF-like statements (its observationAbout, a StatisticalVariable, defining the measuredPoperty; its observationAbout property indicating the entity the statement is about, and [[value]] )  In the context of a quantitative knowledge graph, typical properties could include [[measuredProperty]], [[observationAbout]], [[observationDate]], [[value]], [[unitCode]], [[unitText]], [[measurementMethod]].     
 * @property {Enumeration} Provides additional qualification to an observation. For example, a GDP observation measures the Nominal value.
 * @property {Text | DefinedTerm | MeasurementMethodEnum | URL} A subproperty of [[measurementTechnique]] that can be used for specifying specific methods, in particular via [[MeasurementMethodEnum]].
 * @property {Thing | Place} The [[observationAbout]] property identifies an entity, often a [[Place]], associated with an [[Observation]].
 * @property {Text} The length of time an Observation took place over. The format follows `P[0-9]*[Y|M|D|h|m|s]`. For example, P1Y is Period 1 Year, P3M is Period 3 Months, P3h is Period 3 hours.
 * @property {PropertyValue | Property | Text | StatisticalVariable} The variableMeasured property can indicate (repeated as necessary) the  variables that are measured in some dataset, either described as text or as pairs of identifier and description using PropertyValue, or more explicitly as a [[StatisticalVariable]].
 * @property {URL | MeasurementMethodEnum | Text | DefinedTerm} A technique, method or technology used in an [[Observation]], [[StatisticalVariable]] or [[Dataset]] (or [[DataDownload]], [[DataCatalog]]), corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (for datasets, described using [[variableMeasured]]; for [[Observation]], a [[StatisticalVariable]]). Often but not necessarily each [[variableMeasured]] will have an explicit representation as (or mapping to) an property such as those defined in Schema.org, or other RDF vocabularies and "knowledge graphs". In that case the subproperty of [[variableMeasured]] called [[measuredProperty]] is applicable.      The [[measurementTechnique]] property helps when extra clarification is needed about how a [[measuredProperty]] was measured. This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but can often serve as a high level summary for dataset discovery.   For example, if [[variableMeasured]] is: molecule concentration, [[measurementTechnique]] could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence". If the [[variableMeasured]] is "depression rating", the [[measurementTechnique]] could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory".   If there are several [[variableMeasured]] properties recorded for some given data object, use a [[PropertyValue]] for each [[variableMeasured]] and attach the corresponding [[measurementTechnique]]. The value can also be from an enumeration, organized as a [[MeasurementMetholdEnumeration]].
 * @property {DateTime} The observationDate of an [[Observation]].
 * @property {Property} The measuredProperty of an [[Observation]], typically via its [[StatisticalVariable]]. There are various kinds of applicable [[Property]]: a schema.org property, a property from other RDF-compatible systems, e.g. W3C RDF Data Cube, Data Commons, Wikidata, or schema.org extensions such as [GS1's](https://www.gs1.org/voc/?show=properties).
 * @property {StatisticalVariable} Identifies the denominator variable when an observation represents a ratio or percentage.

In practice many news publishers produce a wide variety of article types, many of which might be considered a [[NewsArticle]] but not a [[ReportageNewsArticle]]. For example, opinion pieces, reviews, analysis, sponsored or satirical articles, or articles that combine several of these elements.  The [[ReportageNewsArticle]] type is based on a stricter ideal for "news" as a work of journalism, with articles based on factual information either observed or verified by the author, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.  This often includes perspectives from multiple viewpoints on a particular issue (distinguishing news reports from public relations or propaganda).  News reports in the [[ReportageNewsArticle]] sense de-emphasize the opinion of the author, with commentary and value judgements typically expressed elsewhere.  A [[ReportageNewsArticle]] which goes deeper into analysis can also be marked with an additional type of [[AnalysisNewsArticle]].

/**
 * An offer to transfer some rights to an item or to provide a service — for example, an offer to sell tickets to an event, to rent the DVD of a movie, to stream a TV show over the internet, to repair a motorcycle, or to loan a book.\n\nNote: As the [[businessFunction]] property, which identifies the form of offer (e.g. sell, lease, repair, dispose), defaults to http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#Sell; an Offer without a defined businessFunction value can be assumed to be an offer to sell.\n\nFor [GTIN](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin)-related fields, see [Check Digit calculator](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/support/check_digit_calculator) and [validation guide](http://www.gs1us.org/resources/standards/gtin-validation-guide) from [GS1](http://www.gs1.org/).
 * @property {BusinessEntityType} The type(s) of customers for which the given offer is valid.
 * @property {QuantitativeValue} The duration for which the given offer is valid.
 * @property {Place | Text | GeoShape} The ISO 3166-1 (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) or ISO 3166-2 code, the place, or the GeoShape for the geo-political region(s) for which the offer or delivery charge specification is valid.\n\nSee also [[ineligibleRegion]].     
 * @property {Text} The GTIN-12 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. The GTIN-12 is the 12-digit GS1 Identification Key composed of a U.P.C. Company Prefix, Item Reference, and Check Digit used to identify trade items. See [GS1 GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) for more details.
 * @property {Duration | QuantitativeValue} Length of the lease for some [[Accommodation]], either particular to some [[Offer]] or in some cases intrinsic to the property.
 * @property {Text} The [[mobileUrl]] property is provided for specific situations in which data consumers need to determine whether one of several provided URLs is a dedicated 'mobile site'.  To discourage over-use, and reflecting intial usecases, the property is expected only on [[Product]] and [[Offer]], rather than [[Thing]]. The general trend in web technology is towards [responsive design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) in which content can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of browsing environments. Pages and sites referenced with the long-established [[url]] property should ideally also be usable on a wide variety of devices, including mobile phones. In most cases, it would be pointless and counter productive to attempt to update all [[url]] markup to use [[mobileUrl]] for more mobile-oriented pages. The property is intended for the case when items (primarily [[Product]] and [[Offer]]) have extra URLs hosted on an additional "mobile site" alongside the main one. It should not be taken as an endorsement of this publication style.     
 * @property {PriceSpecification} The transaction volume, in a monetary unit, for which the offer or price specification is valid, e.g. for indicating a minimal purchasing volume, to express free shipping above a certain order volume, or to limit the acceptance of credit cards to purchases to a certain minimal amount.
 * @property {Review} Review of the item.
 * @property {DateTime | Date} The date when the item becomes valid.
 * @property {QuantitativeValue} The amount of time that is required between accepting the offer and the actual usage of the resource or service.
 * @property {Text} The currency of the price, or a price component when attached to [[PriceSpecification]] and its subtypes.\n\nUse standard formats: [ISO 4217 currency format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217), e.g. "USD"; [Ticker symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies) for cryptocurrencies, e.g. "BTC"; well known names for [Local Exchange Trading Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_exchange_trading_system) (LETS) and other currency types, e.g. "Ithaca HOUR".
 * @property {AggregateOffer | Trip | CreativeWork | Service | Product | MenuItem | Event} An item being offered (or demanded). The transactional nature of the offer or demand is documented using [[businessFunction]], e.g. sell, lease etc. While several common expected types are listed explicitly in this definition, others can be used. Using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer.
 * @property {Number | Text} The offer price of a product, or of a price component when attached to PriceSpecification and its subtypes.\n\nUsage guidelines:\n\n* Use the [[priceCurrency]] property (with standard formats: [ISO 4217 currency format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217), e.g. "USD"; [Ticker symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies) for cryptocurrencies, e.g. "BTC"; well known names for [Local Exchange Trading Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_exchange_trading_system) (LETS) and other currency types, e.g. "Ithaca HOUR") instead of including [ambiguous symbols](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_sign#Currencies_that_use_the_dollar_or_peso_sign) such as '$' in the value.\n* Use '.' (Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.\n* Note that both [RDFa](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/#using-the-content-attribute) and Microdata syntax allow the use of a "content=" attribute for publishing simple machine-readable values alongside more human-friendly formatting.\n* Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' (U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similar Unicode symbols.       
 * @property {Time | Date | DateTime} The end of the availability of the product or service included in the offer.
 * @property {Offer} An additional offer that can only be obtained in combination with the first base offer (e.g. supplements and extensions that are available for a surcharge).
 * @property {MerchantReturnPolicy} Specifies a MerchantReturnPolicy that may be applicable.
 * @property {Text | PhysicalActivityCategory | URL | CategoryCode | Thing} A category for the item. Greater signs or slashes can be used to informally indicate a category hierarchy.
 * @property {Text} The Manufacturer Part Number (MPN) of the product, or the product to which the offer refers.
 * @property {DateTime | Time | Date} The beginning of the availability of the product or service included in the offer.
 * @property {QuantitativeValue} The interval and unit of measurement of ordering quantities for which the offer or price specification is valid. This allows e.g. specifying that a certain freight charge is valid only for a certain quantity.
 * @property {Place} The place(s) from which the offer can be obtained (e.g. store locations).
 * @property {Boolean} Indicates whether this content is family friendly.
 * @property {Text} The Stock Keeping Unit (SKU), i.e. a merchant-specific identifier for a product or service, or the product to which the offer refers.
 * @property {Person | Organization} An entity which offers (sells / leases / lends / loans) the services / goods.  A seller may also be a provider.
 * @property {Text} The serial number or any alphanumeric identifier of a particular product. When attached to an offer, it is a shortcut for the serial number of the product included in the offer.
 * @property {Text} The GTIN-14 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. See [GS1 GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) for more details.
 * @property {PriceSpecification} One or more detailed price specifications, indicating the unit price and delivery or payment charges.
 * @property {QuantitativeValue} The typical delay between the receipt of the order and the goods either leaving the warehouse or being prepared for pickup, in case the delivery method is on site pickup.
 * @property {AggregateRating} The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item.
 * @property {GeoShape | Place | Text} The ISO 3166-1 (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) or ISO 3166-2 code, the place, or the GeoShape for the geo-political region(s) for which the offer or delivery charge specification is not valid, e.g. a region where the transaction is not allowed.\n\nSee also [[eligibleRegion]].       
 * @property {Text} A URL template (RFC 6570) for a checkout page for an offer. This approach allows merchants to specify a URL for online checkout of the offered product, by interpolating parameters such as the logged in user ID, product ID, quantity, discount code etc. Parameter naming and standardization are not specified here.
 * @property {OfferItemCondition} A predefined value from OfferItemCondition specifying the condition of the product or service, or the products or services included in the offer. Also used for product return policies to specify the condition of products accepted for returns.
 * @property {OfferShippingDetails} Indicates information about the shipping policies and options associated with an [[Offer]].
 * @property {DeliveryMethod} The delivery method(s) available for this offer.
 * @property {Text} The GTIN-8 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. This code is also known as EAN/UCC-8 or 8-digit EAN. See [GS1 GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) for more details.
 * @property {QuantitativeValue} The current approximate inventory level for the item or items.
 * @property {Review} A review of the item.
 * @property {QuantitativeValue} A product measurement, for example the inseam of pants, the wheel size of a bicycle, or the gauge of a screw. Usually an exact measurement, but can also be a range of measurements for adjustable products, for example belts and ski bindings.
 * @property {Text | URL} A Global Trade Item Number ([GTIN](https://www.gs1.org/standards/id-keys/gtin)). GTINs identify trade items, including products and services, using numeric identification codes.  The GS1 [digital link specifications](https://www.gs1.org/standards/Digital-Link/) express GTINs as URLs (URIs, IRIs, etc.). Details including regular expression examples can be found in, Section 6 of the GS1 URI Syntax specification; see also [schema.org tracking issue](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/3156#issuecomment-1209522809) for schema.org-specific discussion. A correct [[gtin]] value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a "GS1 Digital Link" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a [valid GS1 check digit](https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator) and meet the other rules for valid GTINs. See also [GS1's GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Trade_Item_Number) for more details. Left-padding of the gtin values is not required or encouraged. The [[gtin]] property generalizes the earlier [[gtin8]], [[gtin12]], [[gtin13]], and [[gtin14]] properties.  Note also that this is a definition for how to include GTINs in Schema.org data, and not a definition of GTINs in general - see the GS1 documentation for authoritative details.
 * @property {Person | Organization} A pointer to the organization or person making the offer.
 * @property {TypeAndQuantityNode} This links to a node or nodes indicating the exact quantity of the products included in  an [[Offer]] or [[ProductCollection]].
 * @property {PaymentMethod | LoanOrCredit} The payment method(s) accepted by seller for this offer.
 * @property {Text} The GTIN-13 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. This is equivalent to 13-digit ISBN codes and EAN UCC-13. Former 12-digit UPC codes can be converted into a GTIN-13 code by simply adding a preceding zero. See [GS1 GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) for more details.
 * @property {BusinessFunction} The business function (e.g. sell, lease, repair, dispose) of the offer or component of a bundle (TypeAndQuantityNode). The default is http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#Sell.
 * @property {GeoShape | Place | AdministrativeArea | Text} The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided.
 * @property {Date} The date after which the price is no longer available.
 * @property {AdultOrientedEnumeration} Used to tag an item to be intended or suitable for consumption or use by adults only.
 * @property {WarrantyPromise} The warranty promise(s) included in the offer.
 * @property {URL | Text} An Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN) is a 10-character alphanumeric unique identifier assigned by Amazon.com and its partners for product identification within the Amazon organization (summary from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Standard_Identification_Number)'s article).  Note also that this is a definition for how to include ASINs in Schema.org data, and not a definition of ASINs in general - see documentation from Amazon for authoritative details. ASINs are most commonly encoded as text strings, but the [asin] property supports URL/URI as potential values too.
 * @property {DateTime | Date} The date after when the item is not valid. For example the end of an offer, salary period, or a period of opening hours.
 * @property {ItemAvailability} The availability of this item&#x2014;for example In stock, Out of stock, Pre-order, etc.

For example, the motion picture known as "Ghostbusters" has a titleEIDR of  "10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J". This title (or work) may have several variants, which EIDR calls "edits". See [[editEIDR]].  Since schema.org types like [[Movie]], [[TVEpisode]], [[TVSeason]], and [[TVSeries]] can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use [[titleEIDR]] alone (for a general description), or alongside [[editEIDR]] for a more edit-specific description. 
 * @property {Country} The country of origin of something, including products as well as creative  works such as movie and TV content.  In the case of TV and movie, this would be the country of the principle offices of the production company or individual responsible for the movie. For other kinds of [[CreativeWork]] it is difficult to provide fully general guidance, and properties such as [[contentLocation]] and [[locationCreated]] may be more applicable.  In the case of products, the country of origin of the product. The exact interpretation of this may vary by context and product type, and cannot be fully enumerated here.

/**
 * A CreativeWorkSeries in schema.org is a group of related items, typically but not necessarily of the same kind. CreativeWorkSeries are usually organized into some order, often chronological. Unlike [[ItemList]] which is a general purpose data structure for lists of things, the emphasis with CreativeWorkSeries is on published materials (written e.g. books and periodicals, or media such as TV, radio and games).\n\nSpecific subtypes are available for describing [[TVSeries]], [[RadioSeries]], [[MovieSeries]], [[BookSeries]], [[Periodical]] and [[VideoGameSeries]]. In each case, the [[hasPart]] / [[isPartOf]] properties can be used to relate the CreativeWorkSeries to its parts. The general CreativeWorkSeries type serves largely just to organize these more specific and practical subtypes.\n\nIt is common for properties applicable to an item from the series to be usefully applied to the containing group. Schema.org attempts to anticipate some of these cases, but publishers should be free to apply properties of the series parts to the series as a whole wherever they seem appropriate.

 * A property-value pair, e.g. representing a feature of a product or place. Use the 'name' property for the name of the property.

 * @property {Text} A string or text indicating the unit of measurement. Useful if you cannot provide a standard unit code for <a href='unitCode'>unitCode</a>.
 * @property {URL | Text} The unit of measurement given using the UN/CEFACT Common Code (3 characters) or a URL. Other codes than the UN/CEFACT Common Code may be used with a prefix followed by a colon.
 * @property {Text | DefinedTerm | MeasurementMethodEnum | URL} A subproperty of [[measurementTechnique]] that can be used for specifying specific methods, in particular via [[MeasurementMethodEnum]].
 * @property {URL | MeasurementMethodEnum | Text | DefinedTerm} A technique, method or technology used in an [[Observation]], [[StatisticalVariable]] or [[Dataset]] (or [[DataDownload]], [[DataCatalog]]), corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (for datasets, described using [[variableMeasured]]; for [[Observation]], a [[StatisticalVariable]]). Often but not necessarily each [[variableMeasured]] will have an explicit representation as (or mapping to) an property such as those defined in Schema.org, or other RDF vocabularies and "knowledge graphs". In that case the subproperty of [[variableMeasured]] called [[measuredProperty]] is applicable.      The [[measurementTechnique]] property helps when extra clarification is needed about how a [[measuredProperty]] was measured. This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but can often serve as a high level summary for dataset discovery.   For example, if [[variableMeasured]] is: molecule concentration, [[measurementTechnique]] could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence". If the [[variableMeasured]] is "depression rating", the [[measurementTechnique]] could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory".   If there are several [[variableMeasured]] properties recorded for some given data object, use a [[PropertyValue]] for each [[variableMeasured]] and attach the corresponding [[measurementTechnique]]. The value can also be from an enumeration, organized as a [[MeasurementMetholdEnumeration]].
 * @property {Number | StructuredValue | Boolean | Text} The value of a [[QuantitativeValue]] (including [[Observation]]) or property value node.\n\n* For [[QuantitativeValue]] and [[MonetaryAmount]], the recommended type for values is 'Number'.\n* For [[PropertyValue]], it can be 'Text', 'Number', 'Boolean', or 'StructuredValue'.\n* Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' (U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similar Unicode symbols.\n* Use '.' (Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.
 * @property {QuantitativeValue | PropertyValue | StructuredValue | Text | DefinedTerm | Enumeration | QualitativeValue | MeasurementTypeEnumeration} A secondary value that provides additional information on the original value, e.g. a reference temperature or a type of measurement.
 * @property {Number} The lower value of some characteristic or property.
 * @property {Number} The upper value of some characteristic or property.
 * @property {URL | Text} A commonly used identifier for the characteristic represented by the property, e.g. a manufacturer or a standard code for a property. propertyID can be (1) a prefixed string, mainly meant to be used with standards for product properties; (2) a site-specific, non-prefixed string (e.g. the primary key of the property or the vendor-specific ID of the property), or (3) a URL indicating the type of the property, either pointing to an external vocabulary, or a Web resource that describes the property (e.g. a glossary entry).

In general an EventSeries may seem more Event-like when the period of time is compact and when aspects such as location are fixed, but it may also sometimes prove useful to describe a longer-term series as an Event.

/**
 * An article, such as a news article or piece of investigative report. Newspapers and magazines have articles of many different types and this is intended to cover them all.\n\nSee also [blog post](http://blog.schema.org/2014/09/schemaorg-support-for-bibliographic_2.html).
 * @property {Text} Any description of pages that is not separated into pageStart and pageEnd; for example, "1-6, 9, 55" or "10-12, 46-49".
 * @property {SpeakableSpecification | URL} Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech.  The *speakable* property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values:  1.) *id-value* URL references - uses *id-value* of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of *speakable* has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.  2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, e.g. via class attribute. Use the [[cssSelector]] property.  3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the [[xpath]] property.   For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this we define a supporting type, [[SpeakableSpecification]]  which is defined to be a possible value of the *speakable* property.          
 * @property {Text} The actual body of the article.
 * @property {CreativeWork | Text} For an [[Article]], typically a [[NewsArticle]], the backstory property provides a textual summary giving a brief explanation of why and how an article was created. In a journalistic setting this could include information about reporting process, methods, interviews, data sources, etc.
 * @property {Text | Integer} The page on which the work starts; for example "135" or "xiii".
 * @property {Text | Integer} The page on which the work ends; for example "138" or "xvi".
 * @property {Text} Articles may belong to one or more 'sections' in a magazine or newspaper, such as Sports, Lifestyle, etc.
 * @property {Integer} The number of words in the text of the Article.

For example, during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size, prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially visible.

The *speakable* property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values:  1.) *id-value* URL references - uses *id-value* of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of *speakable* has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.  2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, e.g. via class attribute. Use the [[cssSelector]] property.  3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the [[xpath]] property.   For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this we define a supporting type, [[SpeakableSpecification]]  which is defined to be a possible value of the *speakable* property.

/**
 * A SpecialAnnouncement combines a simple date-stamped textual information update       with contextualized Web links and other structured data.  It represents an information update made by a       locally-oriented organization, for example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers,  community groups, police,       local government.  For work in progress guidelines on Coronavirus-related markup see [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#).  The motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the [Coronavirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic), and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org expect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges from use. In addition to our usual [Github entry](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490), feedback comments can also be provided in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#).   While this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information, it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like [CAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol), although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover the kinds of everyday practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency situation.  Several kinds of information can be provided:  We encourage the provision of "name", "text", "datePosted", "expires" (if appropriate), "category" and "url" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide a value for "category" where possible, most ideally as a well known URL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20\_coronavirus\_pandemic" or "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910".  For many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For an inline description, use a [[WebContent]] type, and provide the url as a property of that, alongside at least a simple "[[text]]" summary of the page. It is unlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible properties simultaneously.  We expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain more specialized structured data, e.g. contact info, [[openingHours]], [[Event]], [[FAQPage]] etc. By linking to those pages from a [[SpecialAnnouncement]] you can help make it clearer that the events are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus) indicated by the [[category]] property of the [[SpecialAnnouncement]].  Many [[SpecialAnnouncement]]s will relate to particular regions and to identifiable local organizations. Use [[spatialCoverage]] for the region, and [[announcementLocation]] to indicate specific [[LocalBusiness]]es and [[CivicStructure]]s. If the announcement affects both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library closure that serves an entire region), use both [[spatialCoverage]] and [[announcementLocation]].  The [[about]] property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus of the announcement. We now recommend using [[about]] only for representing non-location entities (e.g. a [[Course]] or a [[RadioStation]]). For places, use [[announcementLocation]] and [[spatialCoverage]]. Consumers of this markup should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of [[about]] for locations too.  The basic content of [[SpecialAnnouncement]] is similar to that of an [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) or [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)) feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be shared by posting [[SpecialAnnouncement]] updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD.

/**
 * [[StatisticalVariable]] represents any type of statistical metric that can be measured at a place and time. The usage pattern for [[StatisticalVariable]] is typically expressed using [[Observation]] with an explicit [[populationType]], which is a type, typically drawn from Schema.org. Each [[StatisticalVariable]] is marked as a [[ConstraintNode]], meaning that some properties (those listed using [[constraintProperty]]) serve in this setting solely to define the statistical variable rather than literally describe a specific person, place or thing. For example, a [[StatisticalVariable]] Median_Height_Person_Female representing the median height of women, could be written as follows: the population type is [[Person]]; the measuredProperty [[height]]; the [[statType]] [[median]]; the [[gender]] [[Female]]. It is important to note that there are many kinds of scientific quantitative observation which are not fully, perfectly or unambiguously described following this pattern, or with solely Schema.org terminology. The approach taken here is designed to allow partial, incremental or minimal description of [[StatisticalVariable]]s, and the use of detailed sets of entity and property IDs from external repositories. The [[measurementMethod]], [[unitCode]] and [[unitText]] properties can also be used to clarify the specific nature and notation of an observed measurement. 
 * @property {Enumeration} Provides additional qualification to an observation. For example, a GDP observation measures the Nominal value.
 * @property {Text | DefinedTerm | MeasurementMethodEnum | URL} A subproperty of [[measurementTechnique]] that can be used for specifying specific methods, in particular via [[MeasurementMethodEnum]].
 * @property {URL | Property | Text} Indicates the kind of statistic represented by a [[StatisticalVariable]], e.g. mean, count etc. The value of statType is a property, either from within Schema.org (e.g. [[count]], [[median]], [[marginOfError]], [[maxValue]], [[minValue]]) or from other compatible (e.g. RDF) systems such as DataCommons.org or Wikidata.org. 
 * @property {URL | MeasurementMethodEnum | Text | DefinedTerm} A technique, method or technology used in an [[Observation]], [[StatisticalVariable]] or [[Dataset]] (or [[DataDownload]], [[DataCatalog]]), corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (for datasets, described using [[variableMeasured]]; for [[Observation]], a [[StatisticalVariable]]). Often but not necessarily each [[variableMeasured]] will have an explicit representation as (or mapping to) an property such as those defined in Schema.org, or other RDF vocabularies and "knowledge graphs". In that case the subproperty of [[variableMeasured]] called [[measuredProperty]] is applicable.      The [[measurementTechnique]] property helps when extra clarification is needed about how a [[measuredProperty]] was measured. This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but can often serve as a high level summary for dataset discovery.   For example, if [[variableMeasured]] is: molecule concentration, [[measurementTechnique]] could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence". If the [[variableMeasured]] is "depression rating", the [[measurementTechnique]] could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory".   If there are several [[variableMeasured]] properties recorded for some given data object, use a [[PropertyValue]] for each [[variableMeasured]] and attach the corresponding [[measurementTechnique]]. The value can also be from an enumeration, organized as a [[MeasurementMetholdEnumeration]].
 * @property {Property} The measuredProperty of an [[Observation]], typically via its [[StatisticalVariable]]. There are various kinds of applicable [[Property]]: a schema.org property, a property from other RDF-compatible systems, e.g. W3C RDF Data Cube, Data Commons, Wikidata, or schema.org extensions such as [GS1's](https://www.gs1.org/voc/?show=properties).
 * @property {StatisticalVariable} Identifies the denominator variable when an observation represents a ratio or percentage.
 * @property {Class} Indicates the populationType common to all members of a [[StatisticalPopulation]] or all cases within the scope of a [[StatisticalVariable]].

/**
 * A body of structured information describing some topic(s) of interest.
 * @property {Text | DefinedTerm | MeasurementMethodEnum | URL} A subproperty of [[measurementTechnique]] that can be used for specifying specific methods, in particular via [[MeasurementMethodEnum]].
 * @property {DataCatalog} A data catalog which contains this dataset (this property was previously 'catalog', preferred name is now 'includedInDataCatalog').
 * @property {DataCatalog} A data catalog which contains this dataset.
 * @property {DataDownload} A downloadable form of this dataset, at a specific location, in a specific format. This property can be repeated if different variations are available. There is no expectation that different downloadable distributions must contain exactly equivalent information (see also [DCAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Distribution) on this point). Different distributions might include or exclude different subsets of the entire dataset, for example.
 * @property {DateTime} The range of temporal applicability of a dataset, e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 (in ISO 8601 time interval format).
 * @property {DataCatalog} A data catalog which contains this dataset.
 * @property {Text} The International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) that identifies this serial publication. You can repeat this property to identify different formats of, or the linking ISSN (ISSN-L) for, this serial publication.
 * @property {PropertyValue | Property | Text | StatisticalVariable} The variableMeasured property can indicate (repeated as necessary) the  variables that are measured in some dataset, either described as text or as pairs of identifier and description using PropertyValue, or more explicitly as a [[StatisticalVariable]].
 * @property {URL | MeasurementMethodEnum | Text | DefinedTerm} A technique, method or technology used in an [[Observation]], [[StatisticalVariable]] or [[Dataset]] (or [[DataDownload]], [[DataCatalog]]), corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (for datasets, described using [[variableMeasured]]; for [[Observation]], a [[StatisticalVariable]]). Often but not necessarily each [[variableMeasured]] will have an explicit representation as (or mapping to) an property such as those defined in Schema.org, or other RDF vocabularies and "knowledge graphs". In that case the subproperty of [[variableMeasured]] called [[measuredProperty]] is applicable.      The [[measurementTechnique]] property helps when extra clarification is needed about how a [[measuredProperty]] was measured. This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but can often serve as a high level summary for dataset discovery.   For example, if [[variableMeasured]] is: molecule concentration, [[measurementTechnique]] could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence". If the [[variableMeasured]] is "depression rating", the [[measurementTechnique]] could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory".   If there are several [[variableMeasured]] properties recorded for some given data object, use a [[PropertyValue]] for each [[variableMeasured]] and attach the corresponding [[measurementTechnique]]. The value can also be from an enumeration, organized as a [[MeasurementMetholdEnumeration]].

 * @property {Text} The GTIN-12 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. The GTIN-12 is the 12-digit GS1 Identification Key composed of a U.P.C. Company Prefix, Item Reference, and Check Digit used to identify trade items. See [GS1 GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) for more details.
 * @property {PriceSpecification} The transaction volume, in a monetary unit, for which the offer or price specification is valid, e.g. for indicating a minimal purchasing volume, to express free shipping above a certain order volume, or to limit the acceptance of credit cards to purchases to a certain minimal amount.
 * @property {DateTime | Date} The date when the item becomes valid.
 * @property {QuantitativeValue} The amount of time that is required between accepting the offer and the actual usage of the resource or service.
 * @property {AggregateOffer | Trip | CreativeWork | Service | Product | MenuItem | Event} An item being offered (or demanded). The transactional nature of the offer or demand is documented using [[businessFunction]], e.g. sell, lease etc. While several common expected types are listed explicitly in this definition, others can be used. Using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer.
 * @property {Time | Date | DateTime} The end of the availability of the product or service included in the offer.
 * @property {Text} The Manufacturer Part Number (MPN) of the product, or the product to which the offer refers.
 * @property {DateTime | Time | Date} The beginning of the availability of the product or service included in the offer.
 * @property {QuantitativeValue} The interval and unit of measurement of ordering quantities for which the offer or price specification is valid. This allows e.g. specifying that a certain freight charge is valid only for a certain quantity.
 * @property {Place} The place(s) from which the offer can be obtained (e.g. store locations).
 * @property {Text} The Stock Keeping Unit (SKU), i.e. a merchant-specific identifier for a product or service, or the product to which the offer refers.
 * @property {Person | Organization} An entity which offers (sells / leases / lends / loans) the services / goods.  A seller may also be a provider.
 * @property {Text} The serial number or any alphanumeric identifier of a particular product. When attached to an offer, it is a shortcut for the serial number of the product included in the offer.
 * @property {Text} The GTIN-14 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. See [GS1 GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) for more details.
 * @property {PriceSpecification} One or more detailed price specifications, indicating the unit price and delivery or payment charges.
 * @property {QuantitativeValue} The typical delay between the receipt of the order and the goods either leaving the warehouse or being prepared for pickup, in case the delivery method is on site pickup.
 * @property {GeoShape | Place | Text} The ISO 3166-1 (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) or ISO 3166-2 code, the place, or the GeoShape for the geo-political region(s) for which the offer or delivery charge specification is not valid, e.g. a region where the transaction is not allowed.\n\nSee also [[eligibleRegion]].       
 * @property {OfferItemCondition} A predefined value from OfferItemCondition specifying the condition of the product or service, or the products or services included in the offer. Also used for product return policies to specify the condition of products accepted for returns.
 * @property {DeliveryMethod} The delivery method(s) available for this offer.
 * @property {Text} The GTIN-8 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. This code is also known as EAN/UCC-8 or 8-digit EAN. See [GS1 GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) for more details.
 * @property {QuantitativeValue} The current approximate inventory level for the item or items.
 * @property {Text | URL} A Global Trade Item Number ([GTIN](https://www.gs1.org/standards/id-keys/gtin)). GTINs identify trade items, including products and services, using numeric identification codes.  The GS1 [digital link specifications](https://www.gs1.org/standards/Digital-Link/) express GTINs as URLs (URIs, IRIs, etc.). Details including regular expression examples can be found in, Section 6 of the GS1 URI Syntax specification; see also [schema.org tracking issue](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/3156#issuecomment-1209522809) for schema.org-specific discussion. A correct [[gtin]] value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a "GS1 Digital Link" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a [valid GS1 check digit](https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator) and meet the other rules for valid GTINs. See also [GS1's GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Trade_Item_Number) for more details. Left-padding of the gtin values is not required or encouraged. The [[gtin]] property generalizes the earlier [[gtin8]], [[gtin12]], [[gtin13]], and [[gtin14]] properties.  Note also that this is a definition for how to include GTINs in Schema.org data, and not a definition of GTINs in general - see the GS1 documentation for authoritative details.
 * @property {TypeAndQuantityNode} This links to a node or nodes indicating the exact quantity of the products included in  an [[Offer]] or [[ProductCollection]].
 * @property {PaymentMethod | LoanOrCredit} The payment method(s) accepted by seller for this offer.
 * @property {Text} The GTIN-13 code of the product, or the product to which the offer refers. This is equivalent to 13-digit ISBN codes and EAN UCC-13. Former 12-digit UPC codes can be converted into a GTIN-13 code by simply adding a preceding zero. See [GS1 GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) for more details.
 * @property {BusinessFunction} The business function (e.g. sell, lease, repair, dispose) of the offer or component of a bundle (TypeAndQuantityNode). The default is http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#Sell.
 * @property {GeoShape | Place | AdministrativeArea | Text} The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided.
 * @property {WarrantyPromise} The warranty promise(s) included in the offer.
 * @property {URL | Text} An Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN) is a 10-character alphanumeric unique identifier assigned by Amazon.com and its partners for product identification within the Amazon organization (summary from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Standard_Identification_Number)'s article).  Note also that this is a definition for how to include ASINs in Schema.org data, and not a definition of ASINs in general - see documentation from Amazon for authoritative details. ASINs are most commonly encoded as text strings, but the [asin] property supports URL/URI as potential values too.
 * @property {DateTime | Date} The date after when the item is not valid. For example the end of an offer, salary period, or a period of opening hours.
 * @property {ItemAvailability} The availability of this item&#x2014;for example In stock, Out of stock, Pre-order, etc.

/**
 * ShippingDeliveryTime provides various pieces of information about delivery times for shipping.
 * @property {OpeningHoursSpecification} Days of the week when the merchant typically operates, indicated via opening hours markup.
 * @property {Time} Order cutoff time allows merchants to describe the time after which they will no longer process orders received on that day. For orders processed after cutoff time, one day gets added to the delivery time estimate. This property is expected to be most typically used via the [[ShippingRateSettings]] publication pattern. The time is indicated using the ISO-8601 Time format, e.g. "23:30:00-05:00" would represent 6:30 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) which is 5 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
 * @property {QuantitativeValue} The typical delay between the receipt of the order and the goods either leaving the warehouse or being prepared for pickup, in case the delivery method is on site pickup. Typical properties: minValue, maxValue, unitCode (d for DAY).  This is by common convention assumed to mean business days (if a unitCode is used, coded as "d"), i.e. only counting days when the business normally operates.
 * @property {QuantitativeValue} The typical delay the order has been sent for delivery and the goods reach the final customer. Typical properties: minValue, maxValue, unitCode (d for DAY).

/**
 * The most generic kind of creative work, including books, movies, photographs, software programs, etc.
 * @property {WebPage | URL} Indicates a page or other link involved in archival of a [[CreativeWork]]. In the case of [[MediaReview]], the items in a [[MediaReviewItem]] may often become inaccessible, but be archived by archival, journalistic, activist, or law enforcement organizations. In such cases, the referenced page may not directly publish the content.
 * @property {URL | Text} Media type, typically MIME format (see [IANA site](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)) of the content, e.g. application/zip of a SoftwareApplication binary. In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, 'encoding' can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular fileFormat information. Unregistered or niche file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia entry.

 * @property {Text | DefinedTerm} The item being described is intended to help a person learn the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term.
 * @property {Person} Specifies the Person that is legally accountable for the CreativeWork.
 * @property {DateTime | Text} The "temporal" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. [[temporalCoverage]], [[dateCreated]], [[dateModified]], [[datePublished]]) are not known to be appropriate.
 * @property {QuantitativeValue | Text | DefinedTerm | SizeSpecification} A standardized size of a product or creative work, specified either through a simple textual string (for example 'XL', '32Wx34L'), a  QuantitativeValue with a unitCode, or a comprehensive and structured [[SizeSpecification]]; in other cases, the [[width]], [[height]], [[depth]] and [[weight]] properties may be more applicable. 
 * @property {Thing} The subject matter of the content.
 * @property {CreativeWork} A creative work that this work is an example/instance/realization/derivation of.
 * @property {CreativeWork} The work that this work has been translated from. E.g. 物种起源 is a translationOf “On the Origin of Species”.
 * @property {Place} The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork.
 * @property {Organization | Person} Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The [[sdPublisher]] property helps make such practices more explicit.
 * @property {Person | Organization} A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. E.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event.
 * @property {Text} An abstract is a short description that summarizes a [[CreativeWork]].
 * @property {URL | Text} Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. This property was created primarily to     indicate the use of a specific schema.org release, e.g. ```10.0``` as a simple string, or more explicitly via URL, ```https://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v10.0```. There may be situations in which other schemas might usefully be referenced this way, e.g. ```http://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dces/1999-07-02/``` but this has not been carefully explored in the community.
 * @property {CreativeWork} A work that is a translation of the content of this work. E.g. 西遊記 has an English workTranslation “Journey to the West”, a German workTranslation “Monkeys Pilgerfahrt” and a Vietnamese  translation Tây du ký bình khảo.

 * @property {CreativeWork} Example/instance/realization/derivation of the concept of this creative work. E.g. the paperback edition, first edition, or e-book.
 * @property {URL | CreativeWork} The schema.org [[usageInfo]] property indicates further information about a [[CreativeWork]]. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information, e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options.  This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses.
 * @property {URL | CreativeWork} A license document that applies to this content, typically indicated by URL.
 * @property {Text | Language} The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the [IETF BCP 47 standard](http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47). See also [[availableLanguage]].
 * @property {Demand | Offer} An offer to provide this item&#x2014;for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use [[businessFunction]] to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a [[Demand]]. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer.       
 * @property {Country} The country of origin of something, including products as well as creative  works such as movie and TV content.  In the case of TV and movie, this would be the country of the principle offices of the production company or individual responsible for the movie. For other kinds of [[CreativeWork]] it is difficult to provide fully general guidance, and properties such as [[contentLocation]] and [[locationCreated]] may be more applicable.  In the case of products, the country of origin of the product. The exact interpretation of this may vary by context and product type, and cannot be fully enumerated here.
 * @property {Thing} Indicates that the CreativeWork contains a reference to, but is not necessarily about a concept.
 * @property {Organization | Person} The person or organization who produced the work (e.g. music album, movie, TV/radio series etc.).
 * @property {Organization} The publishing division which published the comic.
 * @property {Text | DefinedTerm} The predominant type or kind characterizing the learning resource. For example, 'presentation', 'handout'.
 * @property {Organization | Person} The author of this content or rating. Please note that author is special in that HTML 5 provides a special mechanism for indicating authorship via the rel tag. That is equivalent to this and may be used interchangeably.
 * @property {Date | DateTime} The date on which the CreativeWork was created or the item was added to a DataFeed.
 * @property {URL | CreativeWork} Indicates an item or CreativeWork that this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense), is part of.
 * @property {Person} Fictional person connected with a creative work.
 * @property {Audience} An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was created.
 * @property {URL | Text | DefinedTerm} The level in terms of progression through an educational or training context. Examples of educational levels include 'beginner', 'intermediate' or 'advanced', and formal sets of level indicators.
 * @property {Text} Identifies input methods that are sufficient to fully control the described resource. Values should be drawn from the [approved vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#accessibilityControl-vocabulary).
 * @property {Boolean} Indicates whether this content is family friendly.
 * @property {Text | Integer} The position of an item in a series or sequence of items.
 * @property {Text} Conditions that affect the availability of, or method(s) of access to, an item. Typically used for real world items such as an [[ArchiveComponent]] held by an [[ArchiveOrganization]]. This property is not suitable for use as a general Web access control mechanism. It is expressed only in natural language.\n\nFor example "Available by appointment from the Reading Room" or "Accessible only from logged-in accounts ". 
 * @property {DateTime | Date} Date of first broadcast/publication.
 * @property {DateTime | URL | Text} The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in [ISO 8601 time interval format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals). In       the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL.       Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945".  Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated.
 * @property {Place} The location depicted or described in the content. For example, the location in a photograph or painting.
 * @property {Text | DefinedTerm} The status of a creative work in terms of its stage in a lifecycle. Example terms include Incomplete, Draft, Published, Obsolete. Some organizations define a set of terms for the stages of their publication lifecycle.
 * @property {DateTime} The specific time described by a creative work, for works (e.g. articles, video objects etc.) that emphasise a particular moment within an Event.
 * @property {Place} The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of       contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates       areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York.
 * @property {MediaObject} A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for associatedMedia.
 * @property {URL | Text} An [EIDR](https://eidr.org/) (Entertainment Identifier Registry) [[identifier]] representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television.  For example, the motion picture known as "Ghostbusters" whose [[titleEIDR]] is "10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J" has several edits, e.g. "10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I" and "10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3".  Since schema.org types like [[Movie]] and [[TVEpisode]] can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use [[titleEIDR]] alone (for a general description), or alongside [[editEIDR]] for a more edit-specific description. 
 * @property {Person | Organization} The party holding the legal copyright to the CreativeWork.
 * @property {Organization | Person} The service provider, service operator, or service performer; the goods producer. Another party (a seller) may offer those services or goods on behalf of the provider. A provider may also serve as the seller.

 * @property {Text} Text of a notice appropriate for describing the copyright aspects of this Creative Work, ideally indicating the owner of the copyright for the Work.
 * @property {Duration} Approximate or typical time it usually takes to work with or through the content of this work for the typical or target audience.
 * @property {Text} The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'.
 * @property {AlignmentObject} An alignment to an established educational framework.  This property should not be used where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, for example to express that a resource [[teaches]] or [[assesses]] a competency.
 * @property {URL | Product | CreativeWork} A resource that was used in the creation of this resource. This term can be repeated for multiple sources. For example, http://example.com/great-multiplication-intro.html.
 * @property {AggregateRating} The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews or ratings, of the item.
 * @property {Text} Headline of the article.
 * @property {InteractionCounter} The number of interactions for the CreativeWork using the WebSite or SoftwareApplication. The most specific child type of InteractionCounter should be used.

 * @property {MediaObject} A media object that encodes this CreativeWork.
 * @property {CreativeWork} Indicates an item or CreativeWork that is part of this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense).
 * @property {URL} A thumbnail image relevant to the Thing.
 * @property {Text} Indicates that the resource is compatible with the referenced accessibility API. Values should be drawn from the [approved vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#accessibilityAPI-vocabulary).
 * @property {URL | CreativeWork} A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL.
 * @property {VideoObject | Clip} An embedded video object.
 * @property {CorrectionComment | URL | Text} Indicates a correction to a [[CreativeWork]], either via a [[CorrectionComment]], textually or in another document.
 * @property {Claim} Used to indicate a specific claim contained, implied, translated or refined from the content of a [[MediaObject]] or other [[CreativeWork]]. The interpreting party can be indicated using [[claimInterpreter]].
 * @property {PublicationEvent} The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent.
 * @property {Person | Organization} A maintainer of a [[Dataset]], software package ([[SoftwareApplication]]), or other [[Project]]. A maintainer is a [[Person]] or [[Organization]] that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on "upstream" sources. When [[maintainer]] is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a [[Dataset]], it is always  possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The [[isBasedOn]] property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work.       
 * @property {Date} Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside [[sdPublisher]].
 * @property {Text} Content features of the resource, such as accessible media, alternatives and supported enhancements for accessibility. Values should be drawn from the [approved vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#accessibilityFeature-vocabulary).
 * @property {Rating | Text} Official rating of a piece of content&#x2014;for example, 'MPAA PG-13'.
 * @property {Text} An award won by or for this item.
 * @property {CreativeWork | URL} The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via [[URL]]) a document describing the editorial principles of an [[Organization]] (or individual, e.g. a [[Person]] writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a [[CreativeWork]] (e.g. [[NewsArticle]]) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the [[CreativeWork]].  While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a [[funder]]) can be expressed using schema.org terminology. 
 * @property {Text | URL} Genre of the creative work, broadcast channel or group.
 * @property {Place} The "spatial" property can be used in cases when more specific properties (e.g. [[locationCreated]], [[spatialCoverage]], [[contentLocation]]) are not known to be appropriate.
 * @property {Text | URL} Media type typically expressed using a MIME format (see [IANA site](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) and [MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types)), e.g. application/zip for a SoftwareApplication binary, audio/mpeg for .mp3 etc.  In cases where a [[CreativeWork]] has several media type representations, [[encoding]] can be used to indicate each [[MediaObject]] alongside particular [[encodingFormat]] information.  Unregistered or niche encoding and file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia/Wikidata entry.
 * @property {Organization} The Organization on whose behalf the creator was working.
 * @property {Event} The Event where the CreativeWork was recorded. The CreativeWork may capture all or part of the event.
